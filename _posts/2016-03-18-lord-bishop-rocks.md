Lord Bishop Rocks for sure is the most exciting and musically gifted Rock trio of the 21st century. They are mixing their brand of 70s influenced Hardrock, Funk, Blues, Jazz, Reggae and Punk -- meshing it into a sound they call Hendrixian Motör Funk.

There have been many trios before them: Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Blue Cheer, Nirvana, Motörhead, Muse, Them Crooked Vultures, Green Day -- all of these groups stand out because they brought a new life and a new perspective in how to make sonic expression in rock music.

[Lord Bishop Rocks][0] has lifted this stylistic template to new stratospheric levels. Imagine Beatlesque melodies, Sabbath's heaviness and James Brown's funk all rolled into one. What is for sure is that sooner than later Lord Bishop Rocks will be rock music's most well known and sought after pure rock trio in the history of the music world.
