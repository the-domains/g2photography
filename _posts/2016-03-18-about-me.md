# About me

During daytime I'm an editor and a photojournalist but after dawn I usually turn into an artist. Many people ask me things about opening hours and prices. This is pretty simple -- assignment photography (or in this case: art) means that I will work for you whenever and wherever you want me to do it, for a specific price. If you want to know the price you got to tell me exactly what you want me to do or what you need, so I can do the numbers and if I'm interested in doing it.

I'm not the right photographer for you if you need another picture for your passport ;o)

So simply drop me an email with some details or use the social media links to get in touch.
